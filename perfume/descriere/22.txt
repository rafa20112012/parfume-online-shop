The composition of the perfume
The dazzling combination of the dessert rose, with violets and bergamot will captivate you from the first moment. In a short time, it leaves the place of the combination of intoxicating jasmine with ginger, outlined by an exotic arrangement of coconut water. The card and spicy finish belongs to the tones of vetiver, guaiac wood and musk.

The story of perfume
The summer atmosphere is also suggested by the Calvin Klein Eternity Summer 2020 perfume bottle, which will restore the summer mood. The design is inspired by the moment when the sun, at sunset, envelops the horizon in shades of red, which seem to touch the sea.

The perfume is conceived as the symbolic opposite of the rising sun, when the hot summer day is just beginning. Calvin Klein Eternity Summer 2020 caresses you like a fresh breeze on your hot skin and reminds you of the familiar sound of the cool ocean waves at dusk.
