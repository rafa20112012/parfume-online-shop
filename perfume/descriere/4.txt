The debut of La Vie Est Belle perfume will delight you with juicy essences of black currants and sweet pears.

The story of perfume
La Vie Est Belle is the option to live life according to your own rules, the freedom to choose your own path to happiness and not to comply at all costs with the expectations of society. It hides a balanced combination of beauty and strength. Launched in 2012, it is the creation of a trio of French master perfumers, led by Dominique Ropion. The bottle suggests a smile transposed into crystal lines, a refinement of the original 1949 version.
