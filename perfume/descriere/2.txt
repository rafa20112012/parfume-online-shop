The composition of the perfume
Eternity begins with notes of citrus, freesia and sage, romantic as a love song. Then it grows like a bouquet of flowers, full of lilies, violets, jasmine, lilies, carnations and roses. The light touch of the exotic sandalwood, the musk and the amber accord persists until the end of the day.

The story of perfume
Eternity is the interpretation of a Calvin Klein-style love story. The modern floral scent is inspired by diamond wedding rings, which suggest a single word - eternity. Eternity perfume was launched in 1988.
