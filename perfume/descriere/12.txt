The composition of the perfume
The composition of Versace Eros Flame perfume is distinguished by strong contrasts. The debut belongs to the temperamental tones of Italian citrus: lemon, tangerine and bitter orange. They are subsequently warmed by Madagascar black pepper and aromatic rosemary arrangements, topped with geranium, roses and peppercorns. The base of the perfume water is composed of rare accords, of Texan cedar and Haitian vetiver, but also of oak moss, patchouli, sandalwood and tonka beans, in perfect fusion scented with sweet vanilla.
